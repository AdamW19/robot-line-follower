# The Basics


This C program was made on a KIPR Link and was produced as a part of [George Washington University's Pre-College Program's Robotics Program](https://summer.gwu.edu/summer-immersion).
The program allows the [KIPR Link](http://www.kipr.org/) to follow a line and when at the end, spin around and go back. We used Legos to form the body of the robot and used two motors and two light sensors.
