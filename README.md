# The Basics


This C program was made on a KIPR Link and was produced as a part of George Washington University's Pre-College Program's Robotics Program.
The program allows the KIPR Link to follow a line and when at the end, spin around and go back. We used Legos to form the body of the robot and used two motors and two light sensors.
